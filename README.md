I want to build a web app to help me learn Portuguese (European). The app is meant for a mobile device - so not a very large screen. The idea is to have the device permanently open with the web page in full screen and it will show flash cards. For example it will show a phrase in English in large letters covering roughly the top half of the screen and then after 10 seconds or so it will reveal the bottom half of the screen which contains the correct Portuguese translation. It should work both ways - EN-PT and PT-EN. The phrases should be generated randomly, or picked randomly from a ready-made dictionary of phrases. The user should be able to specify the material to be covered (which tenses, which topics) in some settings. There should be a settings page where he could turn on certain features. e.g. "top 10 most common verbs", "top 100 verbs", "past tense", "asking questions", etc.
